- Interconnected contracts
  - done: EIP712Base (s)
  - done: NativeMetaTransaction
    - This make use of (inherits) EIP712Base contract to provide the service of meta transactions.
    - MetaTransaction() is only used when we want to perform transaction without send ETH "value". What is somebody sends `value`?
    - In the UniswapV2Router, this complete contract is manually copied.
    - this has a `executeMetaTransaction()` that is not checked properly.
      - no this is wrong analysis, this function has to be public.
      - it is a standard EIP way of using it.
      - regarding address checks, it verifies using digital signature.
  - pending: UniswapV2Router
    - It looks like a repository of all codes.
    - i did not find any implementation of it in live yet, so will park this for later testing.

- Unit testing only
  - done: ChildFarm.sol [MasterChef]
    - An implementation of SushiSwap MasterChef staking contract.
    - Rewards are locked and,
    - All unlocked rewards can only be harvested after specific time.
    - Pool has some additional properties
      - `depositFeeBP` Deposit fee in basis points
      - `harvestInterval` harvest interval in seconds.
    - What is rewardLockedUp?
      - d
    - What is basis point
      - d
    - What is DEPOSIT_FEE_BP?
      - If you deposit LP tokens, 10% of the amount will be deducated as fees.
      - This deposit fee, will be transferred to the feeAddress.
    - No bonus in `getMultiplier()`
  - done: Farm [MasterChef]
    - What is a stratergy for a pool?
      - It determines the total supply of lptokens for that pool, we have to ways to get the lpSupply
        - (if stratergy then) `pool.strategy.totalInputTokensStaked();`
        - (if no stratergy) `lpSupply = pool.totalInputTokensStaked;`
    - lpSupply is stored in state variable
      - `pool.totalInputTokensStaked` is where the LP token supply is stored.
    - Each pool will have a stratergy.
    - What is withdrawalFeeBP?
      - It is fees people have to pay, when you call the `_withdraw()` to withdraw LP tokens.
      - This fees has to paid to `ygnConverter` address
    - What is user.rewardLockedUp?
      - It seems to be some "extra" rewards that are locked up.
    - What is WhitelistedHandler[] or what does whitelisting means?
      - Anyone who deposit LP tokens can set the whitelisted user.
      - Can we give the WhitelistedHandler[owner][owner] = false?
    - Where is WhitelistedHandler[] used?
      - `_deposit()`
      - `deposit()`
      - `despositFor()`
      - `withdrawFor()`
      - `withdraw()`
      - `addUserToWhiteList()`
      - `removeUserFromWhitelist`
    - Locked up rewards?
      - `totalLockedUpRewards` stores the amount of rewards locked up across all LP pools.
    - Check when is the farm harvested and does `nextHarvestUntil` updated after harvest.
      - `_payOrLockupPendingFYGN` is used to harvest the (locked up) rewards.
    - `_payOrLockupPendingFYGN`
      - This means that if you cannot harvest (not reached the harvestUntil time), then your rewards will be locked and the total locked rewards will be updated.
      - Now at a later point when harvestuntil is reached, you can call the same function to harvest all the locked rewards.
    - What is Reward Manager?
      - For all rewards harvested, we need to do an extra step to let the rewardManager know of the harvest `IRewardManager(rewardManager).handleRewardsForUser()`
    - What is YGN Converter?
      - d
    - There is a maximum limits on
      - MAXIMUM_HARVEST_INTERVAL
      - MAXIMUM_WITHDRAWAL_FEE_BP
    - functions which can be called to harvest the lockedRewards?
      - `_withdraw` with amount = 0
      - `_deposit` with amount = 0
    - (done) Check all function that affect the LP tokens transfers either deposits or withdraw or transfers, for all such occurances this value `pool.totalInputTokensStaked` needs to be updated.
      - `_deposit()`
      - `_withdraw()`
      - `emergencyWithdraw()`
      - Yes I have validated that all such occurances did update the  `pool.totalInputTokensStaked` property.
    - Here the `getMultiplier()` is controlled by the value of BONUS_MULTIPLIER
      - there is no such period until which this will be applicable, all is controlled by the owner.
    - depositFor() using owners address
    - Audit all the the public non `onlyOwner` functions

1. Salt is not used in domain separator.
2. getMultiplier() mutability should be set to `pure`
